# MapView-Wikipedia
In this app we use MapKit to display some pins on a map for certain capital cities. We can tap on those pins and navigate to a second view controller which is using WebKit to display information on that city from Wikipedia.
The WebView has a refresh button, as well as back and forward and a progress bar.
